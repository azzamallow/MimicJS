MimicJS version 0.3 Release Notes

- DOM matchers created for Jasmine
- jQuery behaviour testing has been completely removed for now
- Simple ajax implementation. Can now test ajax request/responses although this feature is not nearly complete
- Fixed some issues with deep monitoring feature, had trouble with objects nested more than two levels deep
- Removed the keyword "say" and have now replaced it with "error". This will hopefully make the fact that an exception has occurred
